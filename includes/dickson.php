            the very first place i went to once arriving freshman year :') i lived in 
            a single, but spent most of my time in my friends' triple around the corner. 
            i was a bit upset since i had requested for a roommate, but we ended up being 
            neighbors instead. no matter how gross the bathrooms were or how loud some of 
            my hallmates were, dickson brought me some of my closest friends here at cornell.

        since the dorm room wasn't the prettiest on its own, i went full middle-aged mom with a 
        severe crafting hobby and decorated the entire thing. i was sitting on my bed with a friend 
        one day when i started hearing singing coming from down the hall, which was when i got sung 
        into my a cappella group (one of the girls complimented my decor which made me even happier). 
        i had tried out for different groups my first semester, but didn't get into any  
        and made me realize just how competitive the club scene can be at cornell.
        i remember making these floral hangings to decorate my dorm, and parts of them remain 
        hung up on my apartment walls currently. all of my roommates since living off campus 
        lived in dickson too!

        dickson was also where i got ready for my first slope day. my friends and i the night 
        before cut our shirts in preparation, only to get rained out. i will say though,
        i diyed a shirt and skirt set out of an ithaca is gorges shirt and that outfit remains
        to be one of my favorites. sophomore year was pretty much the only real slope day i'll 
        ever get, but it was pretty great considering my friends and i somehow found each other 
        and made it to the very front right before steve aoki. but, it still sucks knowing my 
        year only will have the one.

                one of my first most vivid memories at cornell was at beebe lake! 
                i came in april 2017 for cornell days when i was still deciding on 
                where to go for college. my friend from high school and i went together
                and got to kayak in beebe lake. it was that visit when i
                realized that i wanted to go to cornell.

                my friend and i came to cornell together, and were cs partners our first
                two semesters. we've continued to stay friends since then, ended up 
                in the same major, and will both be in nyc after graduation!

        now, beebe lake is a classic walk destination for me. staying in my apartment
        all day all year has felt extremely restricting and tiresome, so i try to change
        up the scenery by going outside. i'm still not great at staying active
        since i am 1. a bit lazy and 2. have become accustomed to staying in and get 
        a bit nervous when leaving because of the virus.
        but, my friends and i will walk around beebe lake from time to time and i 
        honestly forgot about the time i kayak until i came back senior year. going on
        these walks has also allowed me to appreciate cornell's campus so much more, 
        and it is weird to think that one day soon enough i can't wake up in the morning
        and walk 10 min to gates hall for a cup of coffee from gimme.

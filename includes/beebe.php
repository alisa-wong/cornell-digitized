            one of my first most vivid memories at cornell was at beebe lake! 
            i came in april 2017 for cornell days when i was still deciding on 
            where to go for college. my friend from high school and i went together
            and got to kayak in beebe lake. it was that visit when i
            realized that i wanted to go to cornell.

        now, beebe lake is a classic walk destination for me. staying in my apartment
        all day all year has felt extremely restricting and tiresome, so i try to change
        up the scenery by going outside. i'm still not great at staying active
        since i am 1. a bit lazy and 2. have become accustomed to staying in and get 
        a bit nervous when leaving because of the virus.
        but, my friends and i will walk around beebe lake from time to time and i 
        honestly forgot about the time i kayak until i came back senior year. going on
        these walks has also allowed me to appreciate cornell's campus so much more, 
        and it is weird to think that one day soon enough i can't wake up in the morning
        and walk 10 min to gates hall for a cup of coffee from gimme.

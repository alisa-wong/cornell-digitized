            like many college students, i survive on coffee. specifically, 
            gimme coffee holds a place near and dear to my heart. since switching 
            to computing and information sciences, i would always be around the 
            engineering quad. so, i would spend probably an absurd amount of money 
            on coffee from the gimme inside gates. i love their coffee so much, i 
            made sure to buy a bag of leftist espresso for my family for christmas 
            this year, and was able to continue drinking gimme's coffee through quarantine 
            over winter break. i also recently walked to gates thinking gimme was open,
            only to walk around campus for half an hour because i got there "before the 
            opening time" when in reality it was temporarily closed.

        gates is also where i spent a lot of time my junior year preparing for internship 
        interviews. it was my go-to spot since the wifi at my apartment was terrible, and 
        gates had the small, sound-proof booths. there was a lot of pressure, especially junior 
        year, to land an internship as it was my last summer before transitioning to full time 
        work. it was in one of those very booths where i had both my interviews for the company 
        i ended up joining. even though i was excited to be in san francisco for the summer, 
        i still had an incredible experience during my remote internship. i met insanely talented 
        and welcoming mentors and friends who taught me so much on a technical level as well as 
        about the industry in general. one of my intern friends and i still remain in contact, 
        even after never meeting in person, and actually worked together on a japanese reading/learning 
        app last semester when i took a leave of absence. i had previously planned to graduate a 
        semester early and start my early-admit masters, but decided to take it easier and enjoy 
        my last year at cornell by taking the semester off but staying in ithaca to focus on 
        new grad recruiting, with my cornell friends all close by.

            as someone graduating with an information science degree and about to be a full-time software 
            engineer, gates always reminds me of how happy i am to have taken the chance on pursuing tech. 
            i went to the groud floor of gates every sunday for my weekly group meetings for introduction 
            to digital product design taught by cornell appdev, the class that peaked my interest in design. 
            i was unsure about switching to tech since i had never coded or even heard of ux design until i 
            got to cornell, but am incredibly thankful that i did. i had my ta meetings for info 1300 +
            info 2300 in gates as well, and have continued to teach info 2300 my last semester. while we 
            no longer get dinners catered and get to grade together, teaching remotely has been nice since i 
            don't have to climb over all of the students lined up outside the tiny room in rhodes hall for 
            office hours. teaching web dev for 3 semesters has given me the opportunity to help other students 
            interested in design/development and possibly in the same situation i was in 2-3 years ago. 
            kyle harms is also an amazing professor who i have enjoyed learning from and teaching with for  
            three years! seeing how much effort he put into adapting the class around the 
            students' needs in a remote setting reminds me of how hard working and kind hearted some of the 
            professors are here, and remind me to be especially grateful for all educators' work in light 
            of the pandemic.

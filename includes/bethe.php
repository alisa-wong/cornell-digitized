            sophomore year, i lived in a suite on west campus with 3 of my friends from freshman year,
            and one random roommate. this was also the only year i actually lived with a 
            roommate in a double. it worked out perfectly since my roommate and i pretty much 
            had the same living habits. we'd get messy at times, but always kept our mess to our 
            own sides. we also both sucked at waking up to alarms, but luckily had similar schedules 
            so we would help each other wake up or yell at one another to shut off our alarms after 
            constantly snoozing them.

        this was the year my friends and i were obsessed with dominos. to be fair, 
        the obsession kind of started freshman year, but i am pretty sure any time it was
        anyone's birthday or we were stressed and wanted to indulge, there we were waiting 
        in our suite since delivery always took forever to then scarf down cheesy bread. 
        our current obsession is saigon kitchen, so i like to think that we have grown a lot 
        since sophomore year. we now order to go, then often go to someone's apartment to
        continue to enjoy our meals together.

        saturday mornings, i would have my weekly meetings for my project team. as a night 
        person, waking up on a saturday morning was painful enough. i always woke up with 10 
        min to get there, then would show up to the meetings sweaty and out of breath 
        after speed walking up the slope. even after walking up the same path pretty much every 
        day of my sophomore year, it never got easier. after the meetings though, my friends 
        and i would walk back down the slope towards west and got dimsum at cook. though we can't 
        go back to cook's dining hall (and i'm not on the project team anymore...), the same group 
        of friends made sure to somewhat continue the tradition and catch up over food at one 
        our houses to remain safe.

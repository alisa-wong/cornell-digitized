                    hi! my name is alisa and my last year of college took an unexpected turn,
                    as it did for those graduating with me. cornell showed me that it was possible 
                    to combine my creativity and desire for technical challenges into a career 
                    path, while providing me the knowledge to accomplish such. though i spent most 
                    of my senior year in my small collegetown apartment, i wanted to use the very 
                    skills i've developed here to commmemorate the spots on campus that have shaped my 
                    cornell experience, and that i dearly miss.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    i will be graduating in may 2021 from the college of arts + sciences with a degree
                    in information science (ux design concentration) and a minor in computer science. 
                    upon graduation, i will be a software engineer in nyc.

            my favorite spot to grab a cup of coffee and people watch, 
            if i were lucky enough to get a spot. i like to think that i have 
            learned the art of snagging a marble topped table (the large opens
            by the outlets were always the best).

        as someone who struggles to be productive in my living space, this 
        was my go-to spot that i miss dearly. zeus was always filled with 
        great energy, and warm soup, or <em>zoup</em> as my friend + i like to say,
        and fresh sandwiches on hand. the constant chatter and smiles reminded me 
        that the people on campus enjoyed the space we shared together and 
        we were not just burnt-out college students 24/7. while we are still 
        able to be in zeus, the tables are separated with one student per table. 
        i'm glad i can still have one last wednesday mac + cheese before i leave,
        but i can no longer work on a pset after class waiting for the lunch 
        rush to pass so that i can treat myself to a $1 chocolate chip cookie 
        around 1:30pm when they bring out a fresh batch.

        the spinach and feta scone. i think i may have had one for breakfast almost 
        every day of junior year, until it came to an immediate halt. i missed it so
        much, that i learned how to make my own at home during quarantine!

    <p class="mb-5">
        i was actually in zeus (sitting at one of the large tables) when everyone 
        received the announcement that we were being sent home due to the pandemic. 
        i remember everyone looking around a bit stunned, yet not at the same time. 
        excited, but scared as well. my friends and i played trump's press conference
        on the possible travel ban, as my friends out of state were worrying over how
        they would get home. it was a beautiful day out, so we proceeded to grab some 
        cookies and oat chais to sit outside by the ad wshite sculpture without 
        feeling the need to worry about classes anymore, and simply enjoy the last moments
        we would have together in-person that semester.

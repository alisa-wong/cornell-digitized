            i will always remember kennedy hall for a couple of very random reasons.
            there doesn't seem to be much of a reason for me to be there since i 
            barely had any classes on the ag quad and always preferred terrace over trillium, 
            but i have an assorted array of very vivid memories that i think represent
            the diverse experience i've had at cornell.

            first, it was where one of my most memorable a cappella concerts was held.
            it was my second semester since joining, and we were very nervous since 
            it was a much larger venue and we had fewer people in the group, which usually
            meant fewer tickets sold. but, we ended up selling out a majority portion of
            seats, and was one of my favorite performances of my 4 years in the group. 
            my senior fall, i served as president of the group and the first to run the 
            organization during a fully remote semester. it was quite the challenge trying 
            to figure out how to run auditions virtually and how to put on a virtual concert,
            but it was incredibly rewarding to see the group work together and be able to 
            adapt to the new challenges. we recruited two incredible newbies that semester,
            and put on our first virtual concert which was also our 15th anniversary concert.
            a tradition we have at our in person concerts is to invite any alumni in the audience
            to sing our last song, the alumni song, with us on stage. instead, we invited all 
            alumni to join us in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TarkrfFFVGo">virtual rendition</a>
            of the song, and were able to have our founder (the original soloist) to solo the song! 
            i also wanted to try to do something good with our collective efforts, so i 
            decided to make it a fundraiser concert for ithaca neighborhood housing services in light of the 
            housing crisis exacerbated by the pandemic, and we donated over $1k and received 
            and an extremely kind handwritten note from inhs!

        kennedy auditorium was also where i had my biomg 1350 lectures, aka the class 
        that made me question whether or not biology was for me. originally applying 
        as biology + society in arts and sciences, it took me around a year to decide 
        to pursue tech instead. this class helped me realize that i really hated 
        memorizing facts all day, and that i probably was not smart enough where research 
        would be interesting because i also was not pre-med. im thankful for the slightly
        painful lectures in that large auditorium that led me to where i am today!

            e-hub in kennedy was where i had my interview for the wardrobe, an organization 
            dedicated to providing a rental service for professional clothing to those in need. 
            this was my first experience in tech upon switching to information science, so i will 
            always be grateful for all that i have learned since working on designing and building
            the digital rental platform. the organization itself does incredible work, especially 
            due to all of the amazing people on the team that i have been lucky to work with. i 
            now am leaving the organization as we began designing and building out a new website 
            more so catered to the purpose of the rental system, and am excited to see where the 
            tech team takes it.

        lastly, i will always remember the one time i waited over an hour outside kennedy auditorium
        for my networks prelim when there was a printing issue with the exams. it's crazy to think 
        that i will never have to take a prelim ever again (thank god).
